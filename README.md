Basic SVC Implementation:
A simple implementation of Support Vector Classifier (SVC) using scikit-learn.
This notebook demonstrates how to generate synthetic data, train a classifier, and visualize decision boundaries.

📌 Features

Generate synthetic binary classification dataset (make_classification)

Visualize dataset distribution with Seaborn

Split data into training & testing sets

Train Support Vector Classifier (SVC) from sklearn.svm

Evaluate model performance

Visualize decision boundaries
