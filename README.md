Basic SVC Implementation:
A simple implementation of Support Vector Classifier (SVC) using scikit-learn.
This notebook demonstrates how to generate synthetic data, train a classifier, and visualize decision boundaries.

📌 Features:
1. Generate synthetic binary classification dataset (make_classification)

2. Visualize dataset distribution with Seaborn

3. Split data into training & testing sets

4. Train Support Vector Classifier (SVC) from sklearn.svm

5. Evaluate model performance

6. Visualize decision boundaries

🛠️ Tech Stack:
1. Python 3

2. scikit-learn

3. pandas

4. numpy

5. matplotlib

6. seaborn

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mushir2004/SVM-Implementation.git
